#Notes from introduction readings


**Most historians who decide to “open” their research notes for public view more closely resemble the first kind of OSS developer than the second. As Andrew Berger has astutely observed, we are usually willing to share sources when we are finished with them, when the publications that they were gathered to support have been released, or when we are not “actively using” what we have found.**

- I found this really interesting, cause its like historians are trying to cling to the old way while appearing to have changed,  they show their work but only the neat tidy finished work, not the messy hard work, not the mistakes and changes.  This makes the "openness" not really honest and still very constructed

**One can focus on the ethical value of sharing, as Black does. But it is also possible to justify open notebook practices in terms of their qualitative value to scholars. Sharing is something that tends to make scholars, qua scholars, happy; presumably it’s why we are in the business of writing, speaking, and teaching in the first place.**

- Interesting thought here, I looked at this in another class about writing theory, how writing is meant to be an inclusive social activity and not in isolation 

**By inviting others to see our work in progress, we also open new avenues of interpretation, uncover new linkages between things we would otherwise have persisted in seeing as unconnected, and create new opportunities for collaboration with fellow travelers.**

- This is so important! We get our ideas and questions about not only history but everything from our interactions and conversations and life experiences.  Why we think academic writing operates outside this system i don't understand

**Yes, there’s problems around copyright and reproducing archival documents, but I think historians have a more fundamental opposition: it’s our data, we collected it, and if somebody else wants the data, they should collect it themselves.**

- I think this goes back to that old sense of grandure that historians of old experienced, where they saw themselves as elite for being the collectors and recorders of history, I've seen this among many older historians who see the digitization of history as the downfall of classical history.  This is really just me reading into things, but often I find that older historians think newer historians are lazy for utilizing digital sources thus possibly making them less likely to want to share their hard work

**How does this happen? Why does communication break?
One answer to that is right in front of us. This is a letter, addressed to one person who might find it interesting. Clarke couldn’t have addressed it to the folks at APL because he didn’t know they would be interested.
And this is why this concept of “openness” has become the most important concept in the digital world.
You don’t know who can benefit from your information, the modern solution to that is to not even try to guess. Unless there is a compelling reason you should always publish it as openly as possible. If you don’t, and nuclear war breaks out, it’s on you.**

- I like this explanation for why sharing information and being open is important
