### Vetting a Website

In the instructions we were told to look at [Recovered Histories](http://www.recoveredhistories.org):

*Examine the site's layout and read its introduction*

**What makes you believe this site is a trustworthy provider of historical texts?**
**What makes you believe this site is NOT a trustworthy provider of historical texts?**

So on a first glance it looks like a good source for historical texts, it seems very official, it has a .org domaine,

Where the site starts to loose me is in the bottom left cornner of the home page you see that the site is *lottery funded* which to me means that the site will be cartering to a specific demographic.
The second issue I have with this is that they are putting the documents into a "narrative" which is of course what all history does but the imprssion they leave is that there narrative is the only narrative.

On their **About the Collection** page they give little insight into how these texts have been organized and the only *why* seems to be making things easier on the reader.
