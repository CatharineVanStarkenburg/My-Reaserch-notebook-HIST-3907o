## Notes, Thoughts, and Quotations

**_"Money should be taken out of academic publishing as much as possible. The money that is effectively being spent by universities and funding agencies on journal access could otherwise be spent on reducing tuition, supporting research, and all things that are more important than paying corporate publishers," says Gershman. John Bohannon, a biologist and Science contributing correspondent, is in agreement and says, "Certainly a huge portion of today's journals could and should be just free. There is no value added in going with the traditional model that was built on paper journals, with having people whose full time job was to deal with the journal, promote the journal and print the journal, and deal with librarians. All that can now be done essentially for free on the internet."_**

- Oh my goodness! I agree with this statement so much.  I often use materials that are avalible outside what the school is paying for and tutition could be reduced so much, and more money could be given to researchers, more professors could have tenure.  There are so many opportunities with making academic journals free and open. 

**_"A better approach to academic publishing is to cut out the whole notion of publishing. We don't really need journals as traditionally conceived. The primary role of traditional journals is to provide peer review and for that you don't need a physical journal--you just need an editorial board and an editorial process," says Gershman._**

- I do like this other option as well.  Any steps towards lowering the costs on libraries would be helpful.  Also making as many journals as possible free would make them more accessible to people who are not in university that may be interested in the subjects they cover.
