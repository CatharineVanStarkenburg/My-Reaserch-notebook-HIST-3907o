# Why I'm Taking Digital History
## By Catharne Hood
### Introduction

When I decided to take a digital history class I got asked the question "why?"a lot, from family, from friends, from people I had just met.  The concept that historians could use something other than an archive or library seemed very new to them.  To be honest it was to me as well.  I had seen a glimpse of the potential of digital history in taking The Historian's Craft, where [Dr. Shawn Graham](http://electricarchaeology.ca/about/) had us build an online exhibit using [Omeka](http://omeka.org/) an amazing tool where we created an online exhibit.  Now aside from this brief and limited introduction I had/have no real idea what digital history is or means to the study and practice of history.

#### **My pervious Experiences**

My prior experiences with computers consists of using [Word](http://www.microsoftstore.com/store/msca/en_CA/list/All-Office-apps/categoryID.64519300?tduid=(664a94fcb2d82738d9b65df6a028366e)(240780)(2316686)(1UzQjzPXg9U-Ux648.n7K6gsg4VjpgyW.w)), [OneNote](https://www.onenote.com/), [GoogleDocs](https://www.google.ca/docs/about/),and social media outlets.  I have never had any experience using the types of skills and needless to say, week one and my mind has been blown!

Being an easily frustrated individual I have generally not had the best experiences with computers and I'm usually very quick to pass off my computing issues to the nearest tech guru (usually my husband).  

#### **What I Hope To Gain**

I that in this course I can learn to use the emense power of the internet to do more than re-post [Buzzfeed](http://www.buzzfeed.com/) videos and quizzes.  I hope to be able to create and contribut to the ever growing knowledge hub that is the Internet.  I want to learn how to use the tools at my disposal to start important conversation, and to be totally honest, to have more fun.  Lets face it, watching from the sidelines while others make cool things using tools I've never heard of sucks!

#### **Concluding Thoughts**

I am beyond excited to get learning all of these new things! I seriously cannot believe how much I have already learned! I'm also super nervous because this is all completely new to me and more than a little daunting.
