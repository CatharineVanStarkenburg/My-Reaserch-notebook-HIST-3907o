###Thoughts about Modual 2

After a hole lot of varrious illnesses and other course work as well as some personal matters I can finally dedicate my full attention to digital history once again!   

###Excersise 1 Dream Case


For this excersise I went to [CWC (Commonwealth War Graves Commission)](http://www.cwgc.org/find-war-dead.aspx?cpage=1) and entered in my sername (soon to be maiden name once I finally do that).  First I searched "Hood" in Canada and only got three results.  Then I expanded that search to include all the countries in the database and I got over 400 resluts to explore.  It's particularily intersting to look at the ages these people were when they were killed.  You know in theory that solidiers died young but when you see their names and ages like that its really sobering. 

What I didn't understand was, what exactly is a dream case?  I have looked through web pages and slides and I still don't understand what it actually is.

### Excersie 2 Outwit Hub

So far this is frustrating.

I'm really not sure what it is I'm actually doing.  I followed the directions and I was able to see some information about the text, but I honestly am unsure of what to take from it.  I'll include a video of my screne to show what I'm doing in my blog.  

### Excersise 3 APIs

So after a discussion with Prof. Graham I decided not to do this excersise.  This is mainly because my level of computer literacy made actually understanding this ver difficult.  I had no idea what I was doing so I decided to move on.
