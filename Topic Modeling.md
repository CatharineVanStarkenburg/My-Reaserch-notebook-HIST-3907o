##Notes, Thoughts, and quotations 

_**...topic modeling, a method of computational linguistics that attempts to find words that frequently appear together within a text and then group them into clusters.**_

In this post Blevins discusses her use of the topic modeling program MALLET she shows how she created different categories for MALLET to sort the words that matched her category.  She seems to have tested the program by first running the category of cold weather.  On the graph you see mentions of cold weather are metioned most in January dipping to the least in June and rising again.  For me I find this amazing!  I can give you such an insight into works that are too long to read in their entirety.

Like Blevins I can see the potential of programs like this.  Especially in History! Sometimes I feel very overwhelmed by the sheer amount of data I need to look at for a course project, and finding relevent materials can be very difficult.  But using a system like this you could very easily identify the materials you need,find them, and put them to use.  

You could also use topic modeling to understand larger topics and to examin trends in historical writing.  The posibilities are really only limited by your own perspective, and ability to use the programs.
